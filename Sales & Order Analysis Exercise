SELECT COUNT(*) FROM JanSales WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

# 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT distinct acctnum
  FROM customers c
  INNER JOIN FebSales f
  ON c.order_ID = f.orderID;

# 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT product, price from JanSales ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)
SELECT product, ROUND(SUM(price) * quantity,2) 'Revenue' FROM JanSales GROUP BY product;

# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum), 
  AVG(quantity * price) 
  FROM FebSales f
  LEFT JOIN customers c

  WHERE f.quantity > 2
  AND length(orderID) = 6
  AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
